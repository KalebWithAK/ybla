                    <h3>EVP & Co-Founder</h3>
                    <p>
                        A native of Statesville, N.C., Tammy attended East Carolina 
                        University and earned a BS in Occupational Therapy. After ten 
                        years of working with geriatric patients, she returned to 
                        college, earning a master's degree in Healthcare Administration 
                        from Capella University. She has held several rehabilitation 
                        leadership positions including one position as a nursing home 
                        administrator. 
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Driven by her love of caring for older patients, Tammy left her 
                    administrative position to return to providing one-on-one therapy 
                    and health counseling for homebound seniors. She left the home 
                    health setting with Carolina Healthcare System in December 2017 
                    to work full time with a much younger clientele.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2006, Tammy joined her husband, John to start YBM Leadership 
                    Alliance. Throughout the years of working with YBM, their unique 
                    leadership development, college preparation, and service 
                    organization for young black men, many requests were made to 
                    create a similar organization for young black women. So, in 2015, 
                    inspired by God, motivated by her teenage daughter, and her 
                    passion for working with young people, Tammy launched YBW 
                    Leadership Alliance with the help of her daughter and three 
                    additional teenage co-founders. Much like YBM, YBW focused on 
                    empowering young high school and college women to be future 
                    leaders. After the overwhelming success of the first YBW 
                    Leadership Conference, Tammy and John decided to meld YBM and 
                    YBW into the Young Black Leadership Alliance (YBLA) in 2017. 
                    Together, they run the organization full time. Since merging the 
                    organizations, Tammy has created many initiatives for women in 
                    YBLA such as “Building Mothers to Lead” to help mothers lead the 
                    next generation, Triple T Tuesday was a social media campaign 
                    providing leadership elements for teens and mothers, and her 
                    most current project, Aspire Sister Circle, which brings 
                    professional black women to engage and inspire young women by 
                    sharing their stories.

                    Forever impacted by his high school guidance counselor’s comment 
                    of “you’re not college material”, John was inspired many years 
                    later by a vision from God during a 2006 Get Motivated Conference 
                    to start the organization that is now known as YBLA.

                    John and his wife Tammy firmly believe that the key to developing 
                    leaders is education, experience, and exposure! With that in mind, 
                    they have exposed many young leaders to worldwide travel including 
                    mission trips to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba and 
                    cultural service-learning trips to Johannesburg, Soweto and Cape 
                    Town of South Africa and Abu Dhabi and Dubai of the UAE.
